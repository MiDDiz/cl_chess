	the appropriate move will be played.
	* When the appropriate situation for promotion occurs, you will be prompted to type the piece you
	want your pawn to be promoted. Options are Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, and Queen.

	* In order to save and quit the game, type "e0" when you are prompted for your moves.
	* Saved game file name is composed of the names of the players: e.g. Shala_vs_Zahra.txt
	* If there already is a saved game, you will be asked if you want to load it or not.
	* If your response is yes(y), then you will be prompted to type the names of the players
	and the game will load. If there is no such a save game, then a new game will start.
